Detailed Troubleshooting Notes
1️⃣ RSS Feeds (Blogs, Podcasts, Industry News)
What Happened:

Some RSS feeds (like The Verge) did not return images, only text.

A few feeds were in XML but didn’t follow a consistent structure, causing parsing errors.

Some feeds timed out or blocked requests from the server because of missing headers.

What We Did to Fix:

For feeds missing images → switched to an alternate RSS source or used a paid API that included images.

For feeds with strict rules → added request headers to pretend like a normal browser request (User-Agent).

For feeds returning broken XML → ran them through an RSS-to-JSON service like rss2json to normalize the data.

Future Prevention:

Always test new feeds in a feed parser before adding them to the site.

Keep backup feeds for each category so if one breaks, you can swap it quickly.

Use a feed service/API that guarantees consistent structure.

2️⃣ Chatroom Integration
What Happened:

Chatroom worked partially but messages didn’t always send/receive.

Connection errors popped up in the console (WebSocket connection failed or CORS error).

When chatbot and chatroom were both enabled, they sometimes interfered with each other.

What We Did to Fix:

Matched the frontend origin (site URL) with backend CORS settings so the WebSocket would accept connections.

Restarted both backend and Nginx after making changes — some errors were from outdated config.

Gave chatbot and chatroom separate namespaces so their connections wouldn’t mix.

Future Prevention:

Always check the browser console for WebSocket errors when chat stops working.

Make sure both backend and frontend are using the same connection URL.

If you add multiple chat features, keep them in separate connection paths (e.g., /chatroom, /chatbot).

3️⃣ SSO (Single Sign-On)
What Happened:

SSO login didn’t work at all — no redirect, or redirect loop happened.

The Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) URLs didn’t match exactly.

The certificate in the server didn’t match the one registered with the IdP.

What We Did to Fix:

Checked the ACS URL (where the IdP sends the user after login) and made sure it matched exactly in both the IdP and our server config.

Updated the certificate file (.cer) to the correct one from the IdP.

Verified time sync on the server — a large time difference can break SSO.

Future Prevention:

Keep a record of all SSO URLs and certificates in a secure place.

Whenever SSO fails, first check:

ACS URL matches exactly (including https:// and trailing slash).

Certificate matches the IdP’s signing certificate.

Server time is correct.

If SSO is down and you need quick access, have a “local login” option for temporary use.

Future Works for TechnicalAcumen
1️⃣ Chatroom + Chatbot Integration
Current: Layout is ready, setup is done, but there are errors stopping it from fully working.

Work to be done:

Fix the errors so messages send and receive without issues.

Make sure both chatroom and chatbot can run together without interfering.

Test sending and receiving messages from both sides.

2️⃣ SSO (Single Sign-On) Login
Current: Configuration files are already in the server, but the site is not connecting to SSO.

Work to be done:

Check all links, login addresses, and certificates are matching.

Fix any mismatch so SSO login works and takes the user into the site.

3️⃣ Search Bar
Current: Search bar design is ready but doesn’t work yet.

Work to be done:

Connect the search bar so it can find pages or content on the site.

Show suggestions when the user types.

4️⃣ Feedback Form (Backend)
Current: Feedback page is there, but messages are not stored anywhere.

Work to be done:

Save feedback submissions into a file or database.

Show a success message after feedback is sent.

5️⃣ Teams Calendar Integration
Current: Calendar page is ready, but not linked to Teams.

Work to be done:

Connect the calendar to Microsoft Teams so events can be shown or added directly from the site.
